The workflow runs in 3 modes `PE`,`SE` and `PEtaSE`. 
**PE** :In `PE` mode the input data is paired end sequecing and the files with `R1` and `R2` files in `.fastq.gz` format. In `SE` mode the dat will be treated as single-end sequencing.  If the input data is paired-end , in `SE` mode the reads will be treated as single end data.  All the files will be merged to generate a single fastq file.
